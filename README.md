# RakshaKavach
RakshaKavach! is an Android application that helps you get a better understanding of your mental health. It is to be used along with the smart watch RakshaKavach Band, also made by our team.
This project is created and managed by DAV Public School, Thane(https://davschoolthane.com). I am, but the developer.

The project uses many outside python libraries:
Kivy
KivyMD
ffpyplayer

All of the above libraries need to be installed using pip install for the app to work
You can download the latest release APK from the releases tab.

Application is still in development stage, many features are missing and/or disfunctional. They will get added/fixed with future commits.
