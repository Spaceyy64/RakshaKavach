Helo! This piece of code helps us to PREDICT HEART ATTACK. In this stoobid README I'll tell about this project.

 ALL THE NECESSARY PIP INSTALL:
1) pip install numpy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.  So while installing this I had a lot of subprocess problme I hope you dont get that problme :)

2) pip install panda: pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. 

3) pip install scikit-learn: scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. OK so this is one of the most important and mose used file in this project.


START OF PROJECT:

So before I explain the whole project, you need to first have a dataset about heart failure. SO what is dataset? Well... A data set is an ordered collection of data. So you first have to add that so the predictor can actually get an idea about prediction of the heart attack. You can find this dataset in this SAME FOLDER :)) Just download it and instead of:
heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv

add your own path folder.

Ok so lets start,

1) first we will evaluate the target and find our data is imbalance or not. Its just 8 line code u jest need copy those number and paste it at the same place.

2) After that we will set up a standard scale 

3) Then comes the confusion matrix

This is all it! If I make yall understand the whole code u all will be bored so i have just given the the three procedure. Its added in the code as well :) 

So gud luck! Check our main APP as well
Bye-bye
